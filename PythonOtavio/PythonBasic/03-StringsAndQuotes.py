"""
today we will learn a little more about string
"""

"""
so in a nutshell String is everything between '' or "", treat it as a text,
so keep in mind that while working with string that it should be text to text
e.g: "hello" + 1
that we are saying there is do the operation + with a string and a int,
and it won't work because string works with text + text
a solution would be 
"hello" + "1"
this is ok
